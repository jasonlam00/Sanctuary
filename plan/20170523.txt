You can ignore the world, but it won't ignore you
/*********************************/
	Prioritization
/*********************************/
Design:
	1 - Hallway with 4 (or more) doors
	2 - 4 playable characters, one belonging to each room and all with different mental disorders
	3 - Characters will follow a specific plotline, with dialogue and preset interactions. Current Order
		- OCD
		- Manic Depressive Disorder
		- Dementia
		- Schizophrenia
	4 - User must go through all characters to reach the end of the game
	
Coding:
 Which jobs are most crucial? 
	Priority 0: Learn processing!
	Priority 1: Create a character (player) that can be moved around using WASD and contains an inventory
	Priority 2: Format 1 character's path, to be able to interact appropriately with any object within in the game (e.g. entering through doors, picking up objects)
      	
 Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?
       Core functionality would be anything basics required for a simplified RPG, like a map and a character. Other things, like dialogue and storyline, are not essential for the first phase of development.
       Character itself is core functionality, but a working sprite is not as essential
	
 Which components are prerequisites for others?
       Characters and Rooms will be prerequisites for Floor

/*********************************/
	Workload Sharing
/*********************************/
 Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
        - The first floor created for the game must be collaboratively tackled, so everyone is aware of the standards for subsequent floors.
	- Any extra floors may then be delegated to a person.
	- Character should be collaboratively tackled, but each person can write a different section of character interactions
	- Story of the game will be collaboratively tackled. 
	- If there is time, aesthetics of the game (eg. Background, characters) will be collaboratively tackled.

	Chronology
/*********************************/
The below timeline may change depending on the time necessary to create the basic skeleton. 
However, sufficient time is given between desired deadlines to give us a more flexible schedule/ opportunity to reflect and seek help.

Game (Basic Skeleton) - DUE 5/24 
- Current work in progress -
	( )Creates a basic, interactable floor map
	(x)Create a background
	( )Creates a user and his/her inventory


- To be worked on at a later date -
Game (First Floor - OCD) - DUE 5/26
	( )The user is able to store items in his/her inventory
	( )User is created and appears on a map
	( )Controls work (i.e. W/A/S/D to move up/left/down/right)
	( )Pop-up messages giving the user instructions are displayed
	( )Tasks are able to be recorded as completed or incomplete
-Playing the game:
	( )The user appears on a map with in an asylum setting
	( )Clicking on different buttons of the pop-up message will give unique scenarios 
	( )The user is prompted with a task (in this case, feeling compelled to sort files on the floor, or checing doors)
