Ignorance is bliss....

/*********************************/
	Prioritization
/*********************************/
 Which jobs are most crucial?
 Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?
 Which components are prerequisites for others?

Design:
	1 - Decide on description of the setting(s).
	2 - Decide on player interactions with objects on floor 1.
	3 - Design how the player gets to the end of the game. 
	
Coding:

	1 - Create a character (player) that can be moved around using A, S, D, and W.
	2 - Format 1 floor
      //if in java
      2D array in which the character interacts appropriately w/ surroundings
      symbols representing walls, doors, items on the ground, etc
      super class Floor
      sub class OCDFloor
      //if in processing
    
 

/*********************************/
	Workload Sharing
/*********************************/
 Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
	- Story of the game will be collaboratively tackled. 
	- If there is time, aesthetics of the game (eg. Background, characters) will be collaboratively tackled.

/*********************************/
	Chronology
/*********************************/
The below timeline may change depending on the time necessary to create the basic skeleton. 
However, sufficient time is given between desired deadlines to give us a more flexible schedule/ opportunity to reflect and seek help.

Game (Basic Skeleton) - DUE 5/24
-Creates a basic, interactable floor map
-Creates a user and his/her inventory
-Utilizes tasks/ mini-games that require users to use concepts learned over the semester

Game (First Floor - OCD) - DUE 5/26
-The user is able to store items in his/her inventory
-User is created and appears on a map
-Controls work (i.e. W/A/S/D to move up/left/down/right)
-Pop-up messages giving the user instructions are displayed
-Tasks are able to be recorded as completed or incomplete
-Playing the game:
	- The user appears on a map with in an asylum setting
	- Clicking on different buttons of the pop-up message will give unique scenarios
