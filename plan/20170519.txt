Ignorance is bliss....

/*********************************/
	Prioritization
/*********************************/

Design:
	1 - Decide on description of the setting(s).
	2 - Decide on player interactions with objects on floor 1.
	3 - Design how the player gets to the end of the game. 
	
Coding:
 Which jobs are most crucial? 
	Priority 0: Learn processing!
	Priority 1: Create a character (player) that can be moved around using WASD and contains an inventory
	Priority 2: Format 1 floor
	Character shold be able to interact appropriately with any object within in the game (e.g. entering through doors, picking up objects)
      	
 Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?
       Core functionality would be anything basics required for a simplified RPG, like a map and a character. Other things, like dialogue and storyline, are not essential for the first phase of development.

 Which components are prerequisites for others?
       Characters and Floors will be a prerequisite for the Building

/*********************************/
	Workload Sharing
/*********************************/
 Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
        - The first floor created for the game must be collaboratively tackled, so everyone is aware of the standards for subsequent floors.
	- Any extra floors may then be delegated to a person.
	- Character should be collaboratively tackled, but each person can write a different section of character interactions
	- Story of the game will be collaboratively tackled. 
	- If there is time, aesthetics of the game (eg. Background, characters) will be collaboratively tackled.

/*********************************/
	Chronology
/*********************************/
The below timeline may change depending on the time necessary to create the basic skeleton. 
However, sufficient time is given between desired deadlines to give us a more flexible schedule/ opportunity to reflect and seek help.

Game (Basic Skeleton) - DUE 5/24
-Creates a basic, interactable floor map
-Creates a user and his/her inventory
-Utilizes tasks/ mini-games that require users to use concepts learned over the semester

Game (First Floor - OCD) - DUE 5/26
-The user is able to store items in his/her inventory
-User is created and appears on a map
-Controls work (i.e. W/A/S/D to move up/left/down/right)
-Pop-up messages giving the user instructions are displayed
-Tasks are able to be recorded as completed or incomplete
-Playing the game:
	- The user appears on a map with in an asylum setting
	- Clicking on different buttons of the pop-up message will give unique scenarios
	- The user is prompted with a task (in this case, feeling compelled to sort files on the floor)
	- Hints are provided to the user to aid in the completion of their task
	- An object is given to the user and stored in the user's inventory upon completion of the floor
	- Message explaining that the user was diagnosed with OCD upon completion of the floor (enlightenment moment)
 
 Game (Additional floors) - DUE 6/2
 -More floors designed to educate the user about various mental disorders 
 -Usage of concepts learned throughout the year (e.g. arrays) in tasks
 -Implementation of a final puzzle

-Implmentation of an elevator/ staircase that allows users to move to different floors by choice
-Interactions with NPC that give responses depending on what the user said
-Awareness of the location of the user in order to change the background appropriately
-Augmentation of inventory to allow more arrangements (e.g. by priority, alphabetical, rarity)
-Ability for the user to withdraw items from the inventory (via binary search)
 
 Game (Extra) - DUE 6/6
-Refining code
-Making code more visually appealing
-Making code output more visually appealing
-Implementing more modular design
-Extra features
  - Timer/ time limit
  - Ability to save
